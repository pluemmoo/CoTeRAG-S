# CoTeRAG-S: Hybrid Knowledge Graph Retrieval for Scientific Question Answering

**Author**: Chaiwat Plongkaew

**Affiliation**: School of Computer Science, Wuhan University

## üåê Project Overview

CoTeRAG-S is a **hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system designed to enhance scientific question answering, especially in high-stakes domains like **biomedicine**. It combines **knowledge graph-based community structuring**, **semantic vector retrieval**, and **term coverage validation** to improve answer completeness, interpretability, and factual grounding.

## üéØ Key Features

- Graph-based retrieval using Neo4j with community detection via the Leiden algorithm
- LLM-powered community summarization using DeepSeek-V3 (671B, 32k tokens)
- Hybrid retrieval pipeline combining dense vector search with multi-hop graph traversal
- Term coverage filtering to ensure all critical query terms are retrieved
- Fallback mechanism using unfiltered node expansion for sparse queries
- Evaluation using RAGAS metrics: Answer Relevancy, Faithfulness, Contextual Recall, Contextual Precision

## üìä Experimental Results (CORD-19 Dataset)

| Metric               | CoTeRAG-S | ChatGPT-4o |
|----------------------|-----------|------------|
| Answer Relevancy     | 0.93      | 0.94       |
| Faithfulness         | 0.60      | 0.89       |
| Contextual Recall    | 0.66      | 0.32       |
| Contextual Precision | 0.77      | 0.67       |

CoTeRAG-S excels at **retrieving more complete and well-aligned evidence**, even if slightly less fluent than ChatGPT-4o.
